# Guyde Buddy

## Overview

Planning for travel can be very stressful and hectic. The list you curate in Google Docs or Notes for every city/state/country you will visit can become very messy and disorganized, and it can take too much time to organize. Sometimes, the places you want to visit in a city (especially when you look for things to do in that city on Google) can be too far from each other and you will have to use Google Maps to find the most efficient paths and maximize crossing off every list in your itinerary, which can be painful to deal with. 

Here to solve the issue, I present Guyde Buddy*, a travel itinerary web app designed to help organize your travel plans and find the most efficient ways to visit the places you want to visit! Travelers can register and log in to save their travel spot list organized by city/state/country. They can add new items to their travel list and the app will auto-curate the most efficient paths to maximize your travel!
