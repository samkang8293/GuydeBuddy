# Guyde Buddy

## Overview

Planning for travel can be very stressful and hectic. The list you curate in Google Docs or Notes for every city/state/country you will visit can become very messy and disorganized, and it can take too much time to organize. Even after visiting some of the travel spots in your itinerary, you may forget to cross them off your list and may accidentally visit the location twice. 

Here to solve the issue, I present Guyde Buddy*, a travel itinerary web app designed to help organize your travel spots! Travelers can register and log in to save their travel spot list organized by city/state/country. They can add new items to their travel list via city/state/country without pulling out their hair on the next destination!

(Guide is purposefully mispelled to combine 'guy' and 'guide' together)
